        A quick and simple inexpensive pizza recipe 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 pack yeast</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
            <li>20 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>20 fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. </li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel.</li>
            <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
